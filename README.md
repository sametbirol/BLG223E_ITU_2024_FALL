### BLG223E_ITU_2024_FALL
This repository is designed to assist students in evaluating their code against solutions provided by either myself or fellow contributors. It is important to note that this repository does not facilitate code sharing. Its primary purpose is to offer a straightforward means of verifying code against solution files generated during code execution, with the sole sharing of these files in the format of .csv. We welcome your contributions to enhance this resource. For further guidance, please refer to the README.md files within each respective folder.

<sub>Until further notice, we are disregarding the carriage return ('\r') characters in line endings by using `diff --strip-trailing-cr.` This approach is aimed at enhancing consistency, especially when dealing with GitHub's automatic conversions between LF and CRLF, which can sometimes be challenging to manage. Given the absence of specific instructions regarding how assistants evaluate our code, this allows you to work without concern for the presence of '\r' until further guidance is provided.</sub>

Task list
- [ ] A real solution file from assistants
- [ ] 0/10 feedbacks from students
