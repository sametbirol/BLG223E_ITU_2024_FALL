## Homework 3 Related Info 📝
- > You will upload a zip file that MUST contain 3 different cpp files named as "binary_tree.cpp", "hybrid.cpp", and "map.cpp". You can also use a header file to organize the common functions into one header file. Do not create additional folders inside the zip. Everything must be directly in the zip file without any folders.

### Include Folder
- Organize your header files within this folder specifically for testing with YAML files.
- Remember to update the header paths before submitting your homework.

### Hybrid Solution
- Verify that each binary tree within the vector is accurately printed into the `output.csv` file.


### Calico expect errors
You can include the following line as the first instruction within the main function of your solution:

```cpp
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
```

By doing so, you should encounter no further complications.

You should now be capable of testing with errors while also printing newline characters.

Please remember to utilize `cout` instead of `cerr`

It has been noted that [@itu-itis22-saydamm21](https://github.com/itu-itis22-saydamm21)'s solution employs the `\n` character rather than `endl`

# BLG223E_ITU_2024_FALL 📚

Welcome to the BLG223E course repository for the Fall 2024 semester at ITU. This repository is designed to assist students in evaluating their code against solutions provided by either myself or fellow contributors. 📝

🚫 Please note that this repository does not facilitate code sharing. Its primary purpose is to offer a straightforward means of verifying code against solution files generated during code execution, with the sole sharing of these files in the format of .csv. 📃

We welcome your contributions to enhance this resource. For further guidance, please refer to the README.md files within each respective folder. 🤝
