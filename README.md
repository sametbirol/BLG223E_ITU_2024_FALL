This repository is designed to assist students in evaluating their code against solutions provided by either myself or fellow contributors. It is important to note that this repository does not facilitate code sharing. Its primary purpose is to offer a straightforward means of verifying code against solution files generated during code execution, with the sole sharing of these files in the format of .csv. We welcome your contributions to enhance this resource. For further guidance, please refer to the README.md files within each respective folder.
